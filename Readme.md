## Yo, I'm a Readme

You will be recreating page - https://github.com/twhitacre?tab=repositories  (make sure to replace "twhitacre" with your username)

Here are the places you will be getting the data: (again, change the username)

Your account info - https://api.github.com/users/twhitacre

Your repo info - https://api.github.com/users/twhitacre/repos

You'll probably want to use Underscore - underscorejs.org



Finished all but a couple things i would like to add( date created, reo description and links to individual repos. also didnt add certain links because of the internal nature of them ie: if you click on them and arent logged in as me, they are of no use. i can do this with the links but it for me, wasnt worth the time because there would be nothing to display.)
